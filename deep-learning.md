# Deep Learning

#### Why deep learning ?

1. Problems with long list of rules.
   When tradition approach fails, ml/dl may help
2. Continually changing environments
   Dl can adapt(learn) to new scenarios
3. Discovering insights within large collections of data
   you might need to find 101 different list of rules for data

#### Why not deep learning?

1. When you need explainability
   the patterns learned by a deep learning model are often uninterpretable by human
2. When the traditional is better option (simple one)
   if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system
3. When errors are unacceptable
   since the outputs of dl aren't always predictable
4. when you don't have much data
   dl usually require a fairly large amount data to produce great results

#### ML vs DL

* ML work on structured data(tree base)
  * Random forest
  * Gradient boosted models
  * Naive Bayes
  * Nearest neighbor
  * Support vector machine
  * ... more
* DL work on unstructured data(image/voice)
  * Neural networks
  * Fully connected neural network
  * Convolutional neural network
  * Recurrent neural network
  * Transformer
  * ... more

# Neural Networks

Steps:

1. Input
2. numerical encoding
3. learns representation(patterns/features/weights)
4. representation output(numerical/prediction probabilities..)
5. output(human understandable)

Components of NN :

* Input layer
* Hidden layer(s)
* Output layer
